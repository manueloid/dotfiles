-- Snippets to fastly type in unicode character in greek by a combination of a trigger glyph (I use ";") followed by the latinized version of the greek letter.
-- i.e. by typing ";a" this will be exanded into "Î±".
-- This is faster because in julia otherwise you'd have to write "\alpha" and press the tab key
-- The list of the symbols have been copied and pasted from https://www.imgt.org/IMGTeducation/Aide-memoire/_UK/alphabetgrec.html
